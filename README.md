# UNP_REGRESSION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_SCREEN_TIME_IMPACT_ON_MENTAL_HEALTH_ANALYSIS

The UNP Regression Project – Digital Habits vs Mental Health Analysis explores the relationship between individuals’ digital habits and their mental well-being using regression analysis. The dataset includes variables such as screen time, social media usage, sleep duration, stress levels, and productivity, with the Mental Health Score as the target variable. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, removing outliers through the Z-score method, and applying Label Encoding to categorical features. Exploratory Data Analysis using scatter plots, heatmaps, and regression plots revealed that excessive screen time and social media use were strongly associated with poorer mental health outcomes. Both Simple and Multiple Linear Regression models were used to analyze and predict mental health trends, and the models were evaluated using R², MAE, MSE, and RMSE metrics. The best-performing model demonstrated a clear negative relationship between digital usage and mental health scores. Overall, the study highlights that maintaining balanced digital habits can enhance concentration, mood, and emotional stability. The project concludes that predictive data analysis can effectively help identify harmful behavioral patterns and encourage healthier digital lifestyles for better mental well-being.
